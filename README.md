# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented as a single-page web application using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates a functional game with a clear user interface, win/draw conditions, and a reset option.

## Features

*   **Interactive 3x3 Game Board**: Clickable cells to place 'X' or 'O'.
*   **Player Turn Indicator**: Clearly shows which player's turn it is.
*   **Win/Draw Detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
*   **Reset Functionality**: A button to easily start a new game at any time.
*   **Responsive Design**: Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Modern Styling**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean and attractive user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers the game logic, interactivity, and state management.

## How to Play

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Player 'X' starts the game.
3.  Click on any empty cell on the 3x3 board to place your mark ('X' or 'O').
4.  The status display will indicate whose turn it is.
5.  The game ends when one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all cells are filled resulting in a draw.
6.  Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game at any time.
