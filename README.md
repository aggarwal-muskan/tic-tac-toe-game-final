# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Enjoy a classic game with a modern, responsive interface and keep track of your wins!

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Intuitive Gameplay:** Click on cells to make your move.
*   **Win/Draw Detection:** Automatically detects and announces the winner or if the game is a draw.
*   **Score Counter:** Keeps track of wins for Player X and Player O across multiple rounds. Scores are persistent until the page is refreshed.
*   **Reset Game Functionality:** A button to clear the board and start a new round without resetting the scores.

## How to Play

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Player X starts the game.
3.  Click on any empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
4.  The game automatically switches turns between Player X and Player O.
5.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the round.
6.  If all cells are filled and no player has won, the round is a draw.
7.  The score counter at the top will update after each win.
8.  Click the "Reset Game" button to clear the board and start a new round. Scores are not affected by the reset.

## Technical Details

*   **HTML:** Structures the game interface.
